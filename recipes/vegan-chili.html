    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 green bell peppers, diced</li>
        <li>3 ribs celery, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 small carrots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ancho chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>2 15-ounce (425 g) cans red kidney beans, drained</li>
        <li>2 15-ounce (425 g) cans pinto beans, drained </li>
        <li>2 28-ounce (793 g) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup (235 ml) low-sodium vegetable broth (or water)</li>
        <li>Optional Toppings: green onions, nutritional yeast, vegan sour cream, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Base Flavor:</b>Warm a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 cup (80 ml) of water (see notes for oil version) to the pot and add the onion, celery, and green pepper to a large nonstick pot. Cook until all the water evaporates, stirring occasionally. Once the pot is “dry” and the vegetables start to turn golden brown, deglaze the pot with an additional 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water. This process should take around 10 minutes total.</li>
        <li><b>Spices:</b>Reduce to medium heat and add the garlic, and carrots to the pot along with the chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and optional cayenne pepper. Sauté for an additional 2-3 minutes, adding a small splash of water if things start to stick.</li>
        <li><b>Simmer:</b>Finally, add the kidney beans, pinto beans, crushed tomatoes, and the vegetable broth to the pot. Bring everything to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to create a simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the lid from the pot and cook uncovered for 5 to 7 additional minutes, until the carrots are tender and the chili reaches your desired thickness. Stir this mixture occasionally, to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b>Serve warm, and top as desired. Leftovers can be store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 5 days and reheated on the stovetop or in the microwave. You can also store this vegan chili in the freezer for up to one month.</li>
